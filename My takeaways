This project gave me a push in Deep learning and computer vision-based problems and gave me a perspective to think about how a real-life problem can be solved using DL algorithms. I am extremely interested in working in AI primarily focused on the healthcare domain. 
Through this code sample, I got an introduction to deep learning CNN architectures, got an insight into the libraries used in python, and worked on OpenCV. Got familiar with working on TensorFlow platform, using Keras APIs to make layers in the network.
This project was submitted at an ACM competition where it secured Runnerâ€™s Up award in category - Best ML based approach.
